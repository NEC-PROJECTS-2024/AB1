### INTRODUCTION

YouTube, as one of the largest video-sharing platforms globally, has transformed the way people consume and interact with digital content. Its expansive user base and vast array of videos attract not only genuine engagement but also unwanted attention from spammers seeking to exploit the platform for various purposes. Among the numerous tactics employed by spammers, commenting represents a prevalent avenue for disseminating spam content, links, or deceptive messages. Consequently, the proliferation of spam comments not only degrades the user experience but also poses risks to platform integrity and user security.

Addressing the challenge of spam comment detection on YouTube requires sophisticated techniques capable of distinguishing between legitimate user interactions and spammy content. While manual moderation can be effective, it is inherently limited in scalability and efficiency, especially given the sheer volume of comments generated daily on the platform. Hence, there arises a pressing need for automated solutions leveraging machine learning algorithms to detect and mitigate spam comments effectively.

This research aims to develop and evaluate a machine learning-based approach for YouTube spam comment detection, with a focus on enhancing platform security, user experience, and content integrity. By harnessing the power of machine learning, we seek to create a robust system capable of accurately identifying and filtering out spam comments in real-time, thereby bolstering the overall quality of user interactions and fostering a safer online environment.

In this paper, we present our methodology, which involves leveraging a labeled dataset containing instances of both spam and legitimate comments to train and evaluate various machine learning models. We extract features from the comment text, user metadata, and engagement metrics to capture the distinct characteristics of spam comments. Subsequently, we employ a range of machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Neural Networks, to classify comments into spam or legitimate categories.

Through rigorous experimentation and evaluation, we assess the performance of our proposed approach in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore, we investigate the robustness of the model through cross-validation and testing on unseen data, thereby demonstrating its efficacy in real-world scenarios.

Overall, this research contributes to the advancement of spam detection techniques on online platforms like YouTube, offering insights and methodologies that can be leveraged to combat spamming activities effectively.
